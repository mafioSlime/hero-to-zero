# Zero to Hero Path

This is a learning guide that I made in order for me to become a front end developer. After five months of learning web development, there were times that I would feel overwhelmed and doubted my ability to code which of course, I would still encounter in the upcoming future as it is part of the learning process. 

This guide will also serve as my documentation of what I learn in a specific programming concept, tutorial, course, or whatever you may call it. The main goal of this activity is to re-learn all the tools and programming languages I already know, for the purpose of rewiring my brain to think differently and retain information that is to be applied in web development use. 

Lastly, I will make projects and push them to GitHub in order to support my documentation. But I will only be allowed to do this if I am comfortable and knowledgeable enough in that certain concept or tool. Of course, one great benefit of doing this is for me to show my future employer  my Github repositories which is a big factor to consider during the hiring process. 

What I will learn: 
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Bootstrap
* Git / Github
* JavaScript
* React JS
* Node JS
